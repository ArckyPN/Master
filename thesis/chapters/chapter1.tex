\section{Motivation\label{sec:moti}}

For millennia human beings have been forging documents, paintings, photographs, videos, and any other type of media, ranging from analog manipulations, like altering shipping manifests on clay tablets, duplicating paintings and altering the development of photos and films, to digital tools with varying levels of difficulties, from complex tools like PhotoShop, GIMP and Photopea for images, AfterEffects, Blender, and Nuke for videos, to easy tools like image filters on social media.

In this digital age, these tools are not only becoming more accessible, but also easier to use, while delivering better results than ever. This has the consequence that it is becoming more difficult to discern real media from manipulated media, especially for people who are less familiar with these tools.

To make matters worse, in the past few years many new tools have been released that are capable of generating new media from just a simple text prompt. Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek, are capable of generating texts, like essays, articles, and more. There are also image generators, like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and Firefly, as well as Sora, Synthesia, and Capsule for videos. The list of these tools grows steadily every day, with numerous additional application types: music generation, voice cloning, face replacements, and many more.

All this has led to the founding of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) by Adobe, Arm, BBC, Intel, Microsoft, and Truepic on February 22nd, 2021 \footnote{C2PA Founding Press Release: \url{https://c2pa.org/post/c2pa_initial_pr/}}. The ultimate goal of C2PA is the development and integration of a taper-proof manifest into digital media, which protocol all steps it has gone through from its creation to the present, as well as the tools, people, devices and locations involved and any additional relevant metadata. This allows everyone interacting with C2PA-signed media to verify that that media is trustworthy and look at the metadata and potentially see that it has been automatically generated, edited, applied with a filter, or anything else.

At the writing of this thesis, there is no specification in regards to applying C2PA to live streaming media and there is also not much material about other people researching into this topic. This thesis will fill in this gap by implementing and evaluating C2PA in a live streaming context.

\section{Objective\label{sec:objective}}

The current version 2.2 of the C2PA technical specification \footnote{C2PA Technical Specification: \url{https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.2/specs/C2PA_Specification.html}} has no explicit specifications for live streaming content and there are currently no public discussions or proof-of-concepts on how the C2PA signing should work on live streaming media. However, there is a specification with a working implementation for fragmented BMFF (Base Media File Format) media.

This thesis will describe and evaluate a proof-of-concept of adapting the existing fragmented BMFF implementation to a live streaming testbed compliant with the DASH and HLS streaming protocols. In addition to this, it will also propose an alternative approach that is specifically catered to live streaming.

\section{Scope\label{sec:scope}}

The aforementioned proof-of-concept is a live streaming testbed, which will roughly emulate a real-world scenario. It consists of four components.

The first component is the Producer with the task of creating a DASH and HLS live stream. That live stream is then forwarded to the Signer, which will sign the live stream with a C2PA manifest. The signed live stream is then published to the Distributor, an emulated CDN (content delivery network) hosting the live stream to make it available for consumption. Finally, the Consumer will playback the live stream, while simultaneously validating the trustworthiness of the embedded C2PA manifest. This testbed is visualized in \Cref{fig:testbed}.

        \draw [arrow] (consumer) -- node[anchor=east, text width=2cm, text centered, xshift=0.4cm] {request stream} (cdn);
        \draw [arrow] (cdn) -- node[anchor=west, text width=2cm, text centered, xshift=-0.4cm] {provide stream} (consumer);
