# Thesis Structure

- Abstract / Zusammenfassung
- Introduction
  - Motivation (What is C2PA used for? Why is it needed?)
  - Object (Explore the viability or C2PA for Live Streaming)
  - Scope (Short overview of what I will implement)
  - Outline (Overview of the following chapters)
- State of the Art
  - Live Streaming (HTTP Adaptive Streaming / DASH & HLS)
    - (anything specific I should mention about DASH / HLS?)
  - C2PA (What is it?)
    - In-depth overview of all the components (Claim, Manifest, Assertions, etc.)
  - Concurrent Approaches (DRM?)
- Requirements (What do I need? Rust, HTTP Server, FFmpeg, Website, DASH, HLS, etc.)
- Design (of the testbed, the four components / include CLI)
  - Producer (Rust script to create FFmpeg command)
  - Signer (C2PA tool/library to sign Live Stream)
  - CDN (content host / distributer)
  - Consumer (Client website to show / verify Live Stream)
- Implementation (Specifics about the actual implementation)
  - Environment (Devices used for Testing / Evaluation)
  - Important Implementation Aspects / Challenges
    - C2PA-compliant TLS certificates
    - Low-Latency chunked Segments
    - Signing Optimization (8 Segments per Merkle Tree) [see](/thesis/notes.md)
    - Lots of re-transmissions of updated Segments
    - BMFF Hashing (Box Position added before each Box)
    - CDN caching (ReplayStream crate + DELETE from FFmpeg (extra) window size)
    - TODO more?
  - GUI (examples images, probably best to keep this above in the Design section)
  - Documentation (helper shell scripts, install instructions?)
- Evaluation
  - Performance Original Impl vs. New Live
  - Latency Impact
  - more?
- Conclusion
  - Summary
  - Dissemination
    - Alternative to Merkle Trees? Too many re-transmissions
  - Outlook / Future Work
    - Low-Latency support
    - MoQ (Manifests as separate Tracks)
    - Integration into Tools like FFmpeg / Cameras
