# Thesis Structure

- [ ] Abstract / Zusammenfassung
- [x] Introduction
  - [x] Motivation (What is C2PA used for? Why is it needed?)
  - [x] Objective (Explore the viability or C2PA for Live Streaming)
  - [x] Scope (Short overview of what I will implement)
  - [x] Outline (Overview of the following chapters)
- [ ] State of the Art
  - [x] Live Streaming (HTTP Adaptive Streaming / DASH & HLS)
  - [x] C2PA (What is it?)
    - [x] In-depth overview of all the components (Claim, Manifest, Assertions, etc.)
    - [x] Fragmented BMFF Manifest structure
    - [x] BMFF Assertion
      - [x] Hashing
      - [x] Merkle Trees
      - [x] Validation
    - [x] Signing fMP4 Files
  - [ ] Concurrent Approaches (DRM, Fingerprinting, Watermarking?)
- [x] Requirements
  - [x] Overview
  - [x] Technical Requirements
    - [x] Producer
    - [x] Signer
    - [x] Distributer
    - [x] Consumer
- [ ] Design (of the testbed, the four components / include CLI)
  - [x] Producer (Rust script to create FFmpeg command)
    - [ ] CLI
    - [x] Settings File
  - [x] Signer (C2PA tool/library to sign Live Stream)
    - [ ] CLI
    - [x] Alternative Signing Approaches
      - [x] Optimized Merkle Tree
      - [x] C2PA data in MPD
      - [x] C2PA data on server
      - [x] Rolling Hash
  - [x] CDN (content host / distributer)
    - [ ] CLI
  - [x] Consumer (Client website to show / verify Live Stream)
- [ ] Implementation (Specifics about the actual implementation)
  - [x] Environment (Devices used for Testing / Evaluation)
  - [x] Project Structure
  - [ ] Important Implementation Aspects / Challenges
    - [x] Signing Optimization (8 Segments per Merkle Tree) [see](/thesis/notes.md#code-additions--changes)
      - [x] Merkle Tree
      - [x] Data in MPD
      - [x] Data on server
    - [x] Extending c2pa-js (WASM validating)
    - [x] Reading BmffHash Assertion (version issue)
    - [x] CDN caching (ReplayStream crate + DELETE from FFmpeg (extra) window size)
    - [x] Producer Inputs and their Specifics (e.g. WebCam stuff, external camera [Sony Program...], etc.)
    - [ ] C2PA-compliant TLS certificates?
    - [ ] Documentation (how to run testbed)?
  - [ ] Documentation (helper shell scripts, install instructions?)
- [ ] Evaluation
  - [x] Lots of re-transmissions of updated Segments (// TODO where to put this?)
  - [ ] Performance Original Impl vs. New Live (signing duration Benchmark comp)
  - [ ] Latency Impact (signing duration is the added latency)
  - [ ] Data Transmission (Uploading to / Downloading from CDN)
  - [ ] Alternative approaches where to put the manifests (in Segments like currently, on separate Server or in the MPD/Playlist)
    - [ ] Merkle Tree not ideal for live
  - [ ] How long does Hashing take?
- [ ] Conclusion
  - [ ] Summary
  - [ ] Dissemination
    - [ ] Alternative to Merkle Trees? Too many re- [ ]transmissions
  - [ ] Outlook / Future Work
    - [ ] Low-Latency support
    - [ ] MoQ (Manifests as separate Tracks)
    - [ ] Integration into Tools like FFmpeg / Cameras
    - [ ] connection between multiple tracks/qualities
